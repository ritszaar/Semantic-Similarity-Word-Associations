# Content-Based Image Retrieval Based On a Word Associations Network

This repository contains the implementation of semantical similarity between images based a word assications network as described in the following paper:

> [**Semantic Similarity Between Images: A Novel Approach Based on a Complex Network of Free Word Associations**][1]  
> Enrico Palumbo - Physics University of Torino, via Giuria, 1, 10025 Torino, Italy [enrico.palumbo@edu.unito.it](mailto:enrico.palumbo@edu.unito.it).
> Walter Allasia - EURIX, via Carcano, 26, 10153 Torino, Italy [allasia@eurix.it](mailto:allasia@eurix.it).

If you use this code, please cite the above paper.

The rest of the repository deals with Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) on the CIFAR-100 dataset. Additionally, other insight have been derived from the network of word associations.
